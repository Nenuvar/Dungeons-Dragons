## Locations 
### Intro: [[01-into-the-feywild#Lost Things|Lost Things]]
>[!quote]+ Lost Thing at the Witchlight Carnival 
>The traveling extravaganza known as the Witchlight Carnival visits your world once every eight years. You have a dim memory of sneaking into the carnival as a child without paying for a ticket. That memory has grown foggy over time, though it still conjures a weird admixture of emotionsâ€”wonder and awe mixed with loss and regret. During this childhood visit, your character lost something. You tried to find it, but got captured by the carnival owners, a pair of mismatched elves. As you were excorted out of the Carnival, the owners left you with a little verse:
>"The carnival goes round and round. 
>The multiverse is our playground. 
>Nothing's free and nothing's lost. 
>Every visit has its cost."
>As time passed, your heart became less heavy, and you gave less and less thought to those childhood events. Now, for reasons you can't explain, the longing to retrieve that which you have lost has resurfaced, as though an old spell has faded away, allowing you to feel the loss as sharply as if it happened yesterday.
