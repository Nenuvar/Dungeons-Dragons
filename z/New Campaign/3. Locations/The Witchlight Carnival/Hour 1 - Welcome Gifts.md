Shortly after the carnival opens for business, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A twelve-foot-tall walking tree garlanded in golden ribbons marches down the thoroughfare. Emerald clouds swirl above the tree and rain down golden, spinning sycamore seeds. Fairgoers try to catch the seeds before they hit the ground. As the seeds gently fall, a chatty squirrel scampers along the boughs of the tree, handing dandelions to select passersby.

The tree is Northwind, a [treant sapling](treant-sapling-wbtw.md) (see its stat block earlier in the chapter), and the squirrel is its trusty companion, Red (see "Dragonfly Rides" earlier in the chapter). As Northwind encourages onlookers to catch the falling seeds before they touch the ground, Red hands the characters one dandelion apiece and encourages each of them to make a wish and then blow the dandelion's seeds into the air.

##### Sycamore Seeds

A creature can attempt to catch a falling sycamore seed before it touches the ground, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Any creature that catches a seed before it touches the ground receives a gift, determined by rolling a `d8` and consulting the Welcome Gifts table. A creature that receives one of these gifts can't gain another one for 24 hours.

##### Dandelion Seeds

A character can make a wish while blowing their dandelion's seeds into the air. The player should secretly write down their character's wish on a piece of paper; collect these notes and keep them somewhere safe. On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of the characters who make wishes. These wishes become relevant in chapter 4 (see "Wish Stones" in the "Brigganock Mine" section).
