A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. The [poisoned](/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature can't knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a [zone of truth](/CLI/spells/zone-of-truth.md) spell.
