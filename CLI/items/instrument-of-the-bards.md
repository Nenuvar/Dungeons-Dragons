# Instrument of the Bards
*Wondrous item, instrument (requires attunement by a bard)*  



An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [charmed](/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [fly](/CLI/spells/fly.md), [invisibility](/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [levitate](/CLI/spells/levitate.md), and [protection from evil and good](/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md).
