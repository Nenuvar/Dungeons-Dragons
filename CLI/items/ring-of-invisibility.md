# Ring of Invisibility
*Ring, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](/CLI/items/img/ring-of-invisibility.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you can turn [invisible](/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is [invisible](/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) with you. You remain [invisible](/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.
