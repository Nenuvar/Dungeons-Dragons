# Staff of Healing
*Staff, weapon, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, or druid)*  
![](/CLI/items/img/staff-of-healing.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/CLI/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: [cure wounds](/CLI/spells/cure-wounds.md) (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), [lesser restoration](/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) (2 charges). or [mass cure wounds](/CLI/spells/mass-cure-wounds.md) (5 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1. the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
