# Elixir of Health
*Potion, minor, rare*  



When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the [blinded](/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded), [deafened](/CLI/conditions.md#Deafened), [paralyzed](/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed), and [poisoned](/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
