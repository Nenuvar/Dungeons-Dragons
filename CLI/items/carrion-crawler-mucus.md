# Carrion Crawler Mucus
*Adventuring gear, poison (contact)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](/CLI/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 200 gp

This poison must be harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) [carrion crawler](/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/carrion-crawler.md). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature is [paralyzed](/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
