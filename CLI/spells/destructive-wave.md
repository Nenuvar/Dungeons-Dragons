# Destructive Wave
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `5d6` thunder damage, as well as `5d6` radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [prone](/CLI/conditions.md#Prone). A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](/CLI/conditions.md#Prone).

**Classes**: [Paladin](/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Bard](/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric (Tempest Domain)](/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric-tempest-domain.md)
