# Silence
*2nd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [deafened](/CLI/conditions.md#Deafened) while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

**Classes**: [Monk (Way of Shadow)](/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-monk-way-of-shadow.md); [Ranger](/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid-circle-of-the-land.md); [Bard](/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md)
