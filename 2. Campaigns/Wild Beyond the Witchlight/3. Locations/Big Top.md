*A grandiose show of spectacular feats and magic, and the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch!*

## Big Top

 > [!readaloud|background-red color-red] 
> ![[wbtw-big-top-tent.png|cover hsmall right]]
> The roof of this tent reaches toward the night sky in three swooping peaks topped with spinning gold stars. Painted wooden panels on the tent walls whirl with colorful motion, displaying vibrant circus performances. The sound of music and laughter drifts out through the canvas door.
> [[wbtw-big-top-tent.png|Show to players]]


**Before midnight**, carnival barkers stationed throughout the fair declare:
> [!readaloud|background-red color-red] 
> "Big Top Extravaganza tonight at midnight! Prepare to be delighted!" 

**After midnight**, these barkers shout:
> [!readaloud|background-red color-red] 
> "Who will be crowned our Witchlight Monarch? Join us in the Big Top just before dawn to find out!"

Inbetween the scheduled events, the tent works as a simple carneval shop and info centre. You can buy sweets or get general information about the carnival. When the hour draws near to a scheduled event, the scene is cleared and the tent is sealed off for a short time and several [[witchlight-hand-small-wbtw|Witchlight Hands]] start preparing the stage.  

#### Backstage: Dressing Room

The backstage area is a smaller, circular tent adjoining the Big Top. The curtained doorway between the Big Top and the dressing room is guarded by two [Witchlight hands](witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) (chaotic good), who bicker over the appeal of the acts while sharing a bottle of pear cider. They allow only performers and other Witchlight hands to pass through the curtain but are so distracted by their arguing that any character can slip past them unseen with a successful DC 12 Dexterity ([Stealth](Hurtignotater%20Notion/System/Egne%20notater/Dungeons%20&%20Dragons/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check.

> **Inside the Dressing Room**
> This dressing room is a scene of colorful clutter: tables strewn with makeup kits and glass jewelry, mirrors trimmed with glowing orbs of light, and chests of drawers and wardrobes spilling over with garments. 

If a character searches the dressing room for something fun, roll on the Costumes and Accessories table below to determine what they find.

## Events
### Big Top Extravaganza
The Big Top Extravaganza is the grand event of the Witchlight Carnival. 

Characters who have previously visited the associated attractions gain **advantage on ability checks** during the acts, having familiarized themselves with the performers and their talents.

Spectators file into the Big Top and fill the rows of seats. 

> [!readaloud|background-red color-red] 
> ![[wbtw-mister-light.jpeg|cover hsmall right]]
> The lights dim and a hush falls over the crowd. A second later, a spotlight illuminates a lithe, elven figure sitting in a silver hoop, suspended above the center ring by silk ropes. The elf wears a dazzling suit of diamond-pane mirrors and a pair of butterfly wings. His scepter is topped with a spinning vane.
> 
> "Welcome, one and all, to this evening's extravaganza! I am [Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md). Prepare to be delighted!"
> [[wbtw-mister-light.jpeg|Show to players]]

#### The opening show
> [!readaloud|background-red color-red]
> 
> Suddenly the figures on the stage disappears, and the tent is totally dark. You hear the hushed voices of children anticipating what is going to happen next. 

The opening  show stars a blind Tiefling firebreather accompanied by several [[magma-mephit|Magma Mephits]] and [[smoke-mephit|Smoke Mephits]]. The Tiefling enters the stage blowing green flames from his mouth and beckons the crowd:

> [!readaloud|background-red color-red] 
> ![[wbtw-firebreather.png|cover hsmall right]]
> "My sight has left me and I beckon your aid! Creatures of the elemental planes fair among you, those that only fire can put out. Lead me to them and I shall vanquish them with my flames!"
> 
> The silence in the crowd is almost absolute, so much so that you can hear yourself breathe. 
> [[wbtw-firebreather.png|Show to players]]

With a successful DC 12 [[rules/skills#Perception|Perception]] check, the characters can hear a light swooshing sound to the rows right of them. One of the [[smoke-mephit|Smoke Mephits]] is beside them. If they shout out, the tiefling will come and blow green flames at it. The flames are not hot and will not hurt them, but feel more like a light summer breeze.

### Crowning of the Witchlight Monarch  
>[[z/New Campaign/4. Maps/Big Top Stage]]
>[[wbtw-big-top-stage.png|Show to players]]

Most of the carnival's stars have a part to play in the coronation, which celebrates the joyous zeal of a single guest. The event plays out as follows:

- As spectators take their seats in the Big Top, Dirlagraun the displacer beast escorts [Mister Witch](mister-witch-wbtw.md) from his wagon to the coronation, leaving Thaco the clown behind to guard the Staff Area.  
- [Mister Witch](mister-witch-wbtw.md) and Dirlagraun stand on the sidelines next to Candlefoot as [Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md) gives an opening speech and the monarch is selected (see "Selecting a Monarch" below). Candlefoot holds the hatbox containing the monarch's crown.  

##### Selecting a Monarch
[Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md)'s [Witchlight vane](witchlight-vane-wbtw.md) selects the monarch from the carnival's guests, spinning a thread of golden light that winds its way to the chosen reveler. If the mood of the carnival is positive, choose the character who improved the carnival's mood the most.  [Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md) exudes cheerfulness and follows through with the ceremony regardless of who is chosen.

- [Mister Witch](mister-witch-wbtw.md) removes the crown of golden butterflies from the hatbox and places it on the monarch's head; [Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md) knights the monarch with the [Witchlight vane](witchlight-vane-wbtw.md). Happy clowns shower all three in glitter.  
- Witch and Light escort the monarch on a circuit of the stage while Palasha the mermaid sings a joyous song and pixies flutter all around her.  
- When Palasha's song concludes, [Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md) leads the monarch on a parade through the carnival, with the other guests following as Burly the bugbear sets off fireworks. Meanwhile, Dirlagraun escorts [Mister Witch](mister-witch-wbtw.md) back to his wagon.  

At the end of the celebration, as the carnival begins to wind down, the ceremonial crown teleports back into its hatbox. Candlefoot returns the hatbox to the Staff Area, handing it off to Thaco the clown, who stashes it in the wagon belonging to [Mister Witch](mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md).

The Witchlight Monarch gains the following charm (see [[08-treasure#Charms|Charms]] for more info) and instantly becomes aware of its benefits: 

> [!charm]  Charm of the Monarch
> You can sprout a pair of beautiful butterfly wings. As long as you have the wings, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you gain a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour. After you use this charm three times, it vanishes from you.

### Development 
#NotDone 
- [ ] Note witch character becomes the Witchlight Monarch in the [[z/New Campaign/Story Tracker]]. 
	- Even after the charm wears off, a character retains the title of Witchlight Monarch forever, and this title bears great weight in Prismeer. Fey creatures in the domain will not attack a Witchlight Monarch unless the monarch attacks them first. Moreover, Fey creatures in Prismeer treat a Witchlight Monarch with great reverence, addressing the character as "Your Majesty" or "Your Highness." The characters don't become aware of these benefits until they arrive in Prismeer and interact with its inhabitants.

![The Feywild awaits!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/adventure/WBtW/034-01-018.the-feywild-awaits.webp#center)
#### Through the Looking Glass

If the characters gain leverage over [Mister Witch](mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md), either by stealing the [Witchlight watch](witchlight-watch-wbtw.md) or through some other scheme, the carnival owners lead them to the Hall of Illusions and march them inside:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As Witch and Light move through the Hall of Illusions, their reflections in the mirrors show them as gloomy shadar-kai children, with your own youthful reflections following behind. Soon, they call you to a halt. The mirrors now reflect everyone's true age.
> 
> [Mister Witch](mister-witch-wbtw.md) addresses you in a hushed tone. "Everything you seek and more lies beyond this mirror. If you mean to step through, then stand in front of the glass and repeat this rhyme: Hither, thither, here and there; wander yonder, show me where."
^0f9

Witch and Light won't mention the Hourglass Coven or the splintering of Prismeer, but they share the following information if pressed:

- The land beyond the mirrors is called Prismeer, wherein dwells the carnival's secret patron, the archfey Zybilna.  
- Anyone who sneaks into the carnival without a ticket is robbed of something precious. Whatever is stolen always finds its way to Prismeer.  
- The mirror is a one-way portal. Once they arrive in Prismeer, the characters must find their own way back to their world.  

##### Stepping Through

When a character recites Witch's rhyme while standing in front of their present-day reflection in the Hall of Illusions, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Mist swirls in the mirror, blotting out your reflection.
^0fb

Any creature that touches the surface of the misty mirror is pulled through it and deposited in Hither, one of Prismeer's three splinter-realms (described in chapter 2). If a character tries to take either the [Witchlight watch](witchlight-watch-wbtw.md) or the [Witchlight vane](witchlight-vane-wbtw.md) through the mirror, the item drops to the floor as the character crosses the threshold. Neither item can be taken to Prismeer.

If [Mister Witch](mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](mister-light-wbtw.md) are both present, they wait until only one character remains and then impart the following information to that character:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> *Witch*: "Mind the Rule of Three: future, present, past."
> 
> *Light*: "Find the alicorn and free the dormant queen at last."
^0fc

Proceed with chapter 2 once the characters pass through the magic mirror.
