## Ticket Booth
The booth where visitors buy their tickets is located at the main entrance.

> [!readaloud] 
> A silver statue of a dancing faerie is mounted on the roof of this ticket booth and surrounded by fluttering butterflies. The booth is decorated with an animated depiction of the night sky, with shooting stars arcing across it.
> 
> In the distance you see a group of rowdy children climbing over a tree branch and sneaking into the carnival without paying. Two [[witchlight-hand-wbtw|Witchlight Hands]] spots them and begins to give chase., but they giggle and disperse too quickly, getting away. 

> [!readaloud] 
> An elderly goblin perches behind the ticket counter, peering at you quizzically through a spyglass. He lowers the spyglass and calls out to you:
> 
> "Greetings, fair fairgoers! Buying a ticket? It’s 8 sp for an adult and 3 for a child.”
> 
> He looks you all up and down. 
> 
> “Not sure what you are though. You all look the same to me. But if you can’t pay, don’t worry, we can come to an arrangement!"

After giving the characters their tickets, Nikolas hands the group a map of the carnival and gives each character a pair of colorful cloth butterfly wings to wear. Nikolas explains that the butterfly wings must be worn to show the staff that the characters are paid attendees. They are now free to explore the carnival at their leisure.

## Events
### Bartering for a Ticket
Any visitor who can't afford the price of a ticket or who doesn't want to pay for a ticket can make a fey pact with Nikolas instead. Each pact is a one-night-only deal that ends when the Witchlight Monarch is crowned (see "Timed Events" toward the end of the chapter). If a character chooses to enter into such a pact, roll on the Ticket Pacts table to determine the conditions. A character who barters for multiple tickets can have more than one pact in effect; if any table result comes up twice, choose a different result.

Any character who fulfills the conditions of a pact should be a strong contender for the title of Witchlight Monarch. A character who doesn't abide by the pact loses their ticket, which transforms into an ordinary bat and flaps away. In addition, the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

##### Ticket Pacts
`dice: [](02-witchlight-carnival.md#^ticket-pacts)`

| dice: d8 | Pact |
|----------|------|
| 1 | You must not tell a lie knowingly. |
| 2 | You must wear a crown of flowers and water it every hour without taking it off. |
| 3 | You must perform a short dance whenever you hear someone say your name. |
| 4 | You can't talk about your favorite subject. |
| 5 | You must carry around a small pumpkin as though it were a precious egg. |
| 6 | You must greet all trees with reverence. |
| 7 | You must compliment everyone you meet. |
| 8 | You must declare your love for unicorns at every opportunity. |

### Sneaking Inside 
> [!note] Sneaking Inside
> Any character who tries to sneak into the carnival without a set of fake butterfly wings must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity ([Stealth](Hurtignotater%20Notion/System/Egne%20notater/Dungeons%20&%20Dragons/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check or be spotted and approached by `1d3` [Witchlight hands](witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) of any alignment (see the stat block earlier in the chapter). The hands ask to see the character's ticket; any character without a ticket is escorted to the main entrance and directed to the ticket booth. If the character runs away from the Witchlight hands, the hands don't bother giving chase, but the carnival's mood lowers by one step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in this chapter). A character without butterfly wings who successfully sneaks into the carnival must repeat the check at the end of each hour.

## Developments

As you head past the ticket booth you hear a barker yell out, “Big Top Extravaganza tonight! You will be amazed! Be there right on time or you’ll miss out.”
